# Python Notes 

These are random python notes, mostly made during coding progress, hence messy and personal. However, they might be also useful for wandering eyes! 


Random Definitions:

Learning rate: the coefficient of the gradient of the objective function with which the ML optimization algorithm updates the parameters of the objective function. It is the rate at which ML learns new info and forgets the old ones!
